## 💡 What is Colourstreak?

Colourstreak uses small painted squares and LED's to make a custom display intergrated into cardboard. Using sensors, wireless connectivity, and customizable firmware, it can:

- 🌈 Display vibrant lighting effects triggered by input
- 📡 Connect over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for remote control
- ⚙️ Expand with USB peripherals and smart automation
- 🧠 Run firmware logic on ESP32, customized through Arduino IDE

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Hardware Setup**  
   Start with a set of addressable LEDs (e.g. WS2812B), sensors (motion, light, sound), and an ESP32 board.

2. **Firmware Installation**  
   Flash the microcontroller using Arduino IDE. Upload the pre-built Colourstreak firmware or create your own effects and logic.

3. **Wireless Control**  
   Configure Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to remotely adjust colors, modes, or behavior through mobile or web interfaces.

4. **Expand and Customize**  
   Add USB support for keyboards, gamepads, or smart triggers. Personalize effects using code, enclosure mods, and creative sensor layouts.
